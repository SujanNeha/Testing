It is an expression that has been attributed to a\ndiverse range of sources dating back hundreds of years. These include woodworkers using their thumbs\nas measurement devices, millers assessing the coarseness of ground flour by rubbing it between a\nthumb and forefinger, brewers testing the temperature of fermenting beers and farmers sowing seeds or\nsetting plants at an approximate soil depth.\nWhatever the application, a Rule of Thumb can be considered as a general principle or means of\nestimation derived from practice and experience, rather than precise theory. It represents a method for\nbroad application that is not intended to be accurate for every situation. However, a Rule of Thumb\ncan be easily learned and applied, which means that it can be extremely useful for approximately\ncalculating a value, setting outline targets or rapidly comparing different options.\nAs a construction project progresses from a client\u2019s statement of need, through design and\nconstruction, and into operation and use, project teams seek increased certainty of criteria such as\nlayout, fit, cost and performance. Rules of Thumb, such as those contained in this publication, can\nprovide extremely useful guidance to inform the early stages of this process, such as briefing, feasibility\nstudies and concept design. This may be in the assessment of space and weight requirements, the\npreparation of outline cost models, the configuration of environmental performance targets or the\nevaluation of heating, cooling and electrical loads, for example. Furthermore, Rules of Thumb can be\nemployed throughout the project delivery process to sense-check precise calculations, quickly verify\nthe work of junior construction professionals and rapidly perform what-if scenarios for different design\noptions.\nWhile every effort has been made to reflect current practice and contemporary building services plant,\nit is important to acknowledge that the Rules of Thumb are merely aids to the project delivery\nprocess. They must not be used in place of detailed design, cost or performance-in-use data. The\nresponsibility for the safe and appropriate use of this data therefore rests with each construction\nprofessional.\nThis publication has been designed to be your own personal reference document. Use it, transfer your\nown data to it, and share what you know with others. And please let us know how it works and where\nit can be improved.\nGlenn Hawkins\nBSRIA, March 2011\nRULES OF THUMB 5TH EDITION\n\u00a9 BSRIA BG

the fifth edition of the Rules of Thumb first issued in 1995.\nThe Rules of Thumb have been created by referencing various contemporary sources in the building\nservices industry and can reasonably be held to reflect current design practices. The sources include\nmajor building services design consultancies, concept and scheme design reports produced by\nconstruction project teams, leading plant and equipment manufacturers, the Building Regulations and\ninformation published by BSRIA, CIBSE and others.\nThis fifth edition contains greatly increased guidance about space and weight allowances that is\npresented in a new graphical format. CO emissions benchmarks are included for the first time and are\n2\npresented alongside energy consumption benchmarks. Guidance about costs has been made clearer and\nexpanded to include energy consumption, maintenance, operation and life cycle cost information. The\nsection about system features has been clarified and sub-divided into mechanical building services,\nelectrical building services and natural ventilation. In order to reflect the increasing importance of low\ncarbon design, guidance about compliance with Part L of the Building Regulations, renewable\ntechnologies and air permeability of buildings has also been included in this update.\nEach section is colour-coded as follows:\nSpace and weight\nSystem features \u2013 Mechanical building services, electrical building services and natural ventilation\nCooling, heating and electrical loads\nWater consumption\nInternal and external design criteria\nEnergy and carbon\nCosts\nReaders are advised to use this new edition in place of the previous one, and to transfer over any\npersonal Rules of Thumb they have compiled in the light of experience.\nRULES OF THUMB 5TH EDITION 7\n\u00a9 BSRIA BG 9/2011\n.ypoC\ndellortnocnU\n,0202/70/61\n,bmuL\ndna\nyelnrohT\n,ku.oc.bmulyelnroht@yelnroht.nitram\n:SIC\nmorf\nypoc\ndesneciLSPACE\nSpace and weight allowances\nHow to use the charts of space and weight allowances:\nStep 1 Read the explanatory notes that accompany each chart\nStep 2 Project a vertical line from the bottom axis at a point representing the appropriate plant\nperformance requirements of your project\nStep 3 At the point where the vertical line intersects the red line representing area requirements,\nproject a horizontal towards the red vertical axis. Read off the area required for plant\ninstallation.\nStep 4 At the point where the vertical line intersects the blue line representing height\nrequirements, project a horizontal towards the blue vertical axis. Read off the height\nrequired area for plant installation.\nPlease note that although the two vertical axes have different units, they have the same number of tick\nmarks. This means that a ruler can be used to project horizontal lines that are parallel to the bottom axis.\n1\n4\n3\n2\nThe example shown above applies to the dual-axis charts of area and height requirements. For the\ncharts of operating weight, the following approach should be adopted:\nStep 1 Read the explanatory notes that accompany each chart\nStep 2 Project a vertical line from the bottom axis at a point representing the appropriate plant\nperformance requirements of your project\nStep 3 At the point where the vertical line intersects the green line representing operating weight,\nproject a horizontal towards the green vertical axis.
